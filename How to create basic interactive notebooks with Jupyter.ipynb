The easiest way I could find to add interactive functionality to my notebooks. It is really easy to implement and can be a quick and fun way of exploring data and analyzing results.You will notice that you can craft your own sets of widgets and keep them as tools to be applied under certain situations inside of different notebooks. This is exactly why I like them so much! By the end of this tutorial you will hopefully know how to set up a basic interface to interact with your functions. \n",
